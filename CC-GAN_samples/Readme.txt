These sample audio files are for comparison between CC-GAN Voice Conveter and Cycle-GAN voice Converter.
Original audio files are from VCC2016 (http://vc-challenge.org/vcc2016/)
Speeches from 5 speakers are used for evaluation (SF1, SM2, TF1, TM1, TM3) 

<Original>
SF1_*.wav, SM2_*.wav, TF1_*.wav, TM1_*.wav, TM3_*.wav files are original VCC2016 evaluation data.

<Cycle-GAN>
Cycle-GAN_*.wav files are converted speech data using Cycle-GAN.
10 Cycle-GAN models including 20 generators and 20 discriminators were needed to be trained for 20 source-target speaker mappings.

<CC-GAN>
CC-GAN_*wav files are converted speech data using CC-GAN.
Single CC-GAN model including one generator and one discriminator was trained for 25 source-target speaker mappings (including conversion to speaker oneself).
